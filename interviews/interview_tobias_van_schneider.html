				<div class="interview__question">1. Briefly describe your artwork. What is the idea standing behind the concept?</div>
				<div class="interview__answer">
					<p>I got inspired by the meaning behind the 6 of Club “Messenger’s Card” – Let me quote: “All Six of Club feel an obligation toward duty and they take their responsibilities seriously. Trouble is, the 6 of Club also symbolize inertia.” Essentially Inertia is the resistance of any physical object to any change in its motion (including a change in direction) from a physics perspective.</p>
					<p>In other words, it is the tendency of objects to keep moving in a straight line at constant linear velocity, or to keep still. The principle of inertia is one of the fundamental principles of classical physics that are used to describe the motion of objects and how they are affected by externally applied forces.</p>
					<p>In my <a href="#">example</a> I wanted to combine my love to space/universe with one of the moments of inertia, in this case showing a sphere(shell).</p>
